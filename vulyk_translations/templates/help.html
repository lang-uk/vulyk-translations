<h3>Task Description</h3>
<p>Your task is to evaluate the quality of a translation from English to Ukrainian. Carefully read both the English and
Ukrainian sentences and assign a score based on the accuracy of the translation.
</p>

<h3>Scoring Scale (0-100)</h3>
<p>Use the slider to rate the quality of the translation based on the following scale:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>0-10:</strong> Incorrect translation</li>
	<li><strong>11-29:</strong> A few correct keywords, but the meaning is different</li>
	<li><strong>30-50:</strong> Major mistakes in translation</li>
	<li><strong>51-69:</strong> Understandable but contains typos or grammatical errors</li>
	<li><strong>70-90:</strong> Preserves semantics closely</li>
	<li><strong>91-100:</strong> Perfect translation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional Flags</h3>
<p>If applicable, mark the translation with one of the following checkboxes:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Inappropriate content:</strong> the English sentence contains sexual, harassment, hate speech, violence, or otherwise inappropriate content.</li>
	<li><strong>Unintelligible content:</strong> the English sentence is gibberish or too unclear to evaluate the translation properly.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you select either checkbox, the score slider will be disabled.</p>
