# vulyk-translations
A vulyk plugin to evaluate the quality of translations

## Annotator's manual
### Task Description
Your task is to evaluate the quality of a translation from English to Ukrainian. Carefully read both the English and Ukrainian sentences and assign a score based on the accuracy of the translation.

### Scoring Scale (0-100)
Use the slider to rate the quality of the translation based on the following scale:

- 0-10: Incorrect translation
- 11-29: A few correct keywords, but the meaning is different
- 30-50: Major mistakes in translation
- 51-69: Understandable but contains typos or grammatical errors
- 70-90: Preserves semantics closely
- 91-100: Perfect translation

### Additional Flags
If applicable, mark the translation with one of the following checkboxes:
- Inappropriate content: the English sentence contains sexual, harassment, hate speech, violence, or otherwise inappropriate content.
- Unintelligible content: the English sentence is gibberish or too unclear to evaluate the translation properly.

Note: If you select either checkbox, the score slider will be disabled.
